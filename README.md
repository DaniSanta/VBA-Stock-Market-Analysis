# VBA Challenge - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

I will be using VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Stock market analyst

## Instructions

* I created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* I have a conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

### CHALLENGES

1. The solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

2. I Made the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script so that it will allow me to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
